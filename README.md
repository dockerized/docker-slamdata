# SlamData Community Edition Docker Image

Builds a Docker image for the [SlamData](http://slamdata.com)  NOSQL analytics Tool (Community Edition). 

Contains a basic config that links in a MongoDB database with the connection string _mongodb://mongo:27017_
and expose the Slamdata web server on port 8080. 

If you make sure to link your MongoDB container with a name of _mongo_ it should just work

This is not an official image.
